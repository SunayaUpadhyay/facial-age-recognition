# Face Age Group Classification

This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model that can classify faces into three age groups: old, young, and middle. The model will use image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately categorize faces into the appropriate age group.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a collection of labeled face images categorized into three age groups: old, young, and middle. The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/faces-age-detection-dataset. The dataset contains 19906 images, with each image labeled with the corresponding age group.
